# Big-Data-Analytics
Contains implementation done in Big Data Analytics course.
# NOTE:
Although, these are done in Unix Macintosh with Mojave OS 2019 edition, 
the steps are generic for any Linux system. Most of the things remain same across flavours of linux, 
but there may be slight differences in folder locations depending on the flavour 
or procedure followed while setting up the Hadoop ecosystem, which needs to taken care of separately.
